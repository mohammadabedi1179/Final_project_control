# Anti_Tremor_Spoon
Hand tremor is one of the neural disorders that makes it difficult to do daily tasks. to suppress tremors, the less side effective ways are interesting for the researchers. in this research electromechanical device has been designed to suppress unintentional tremors by an active control system and one of its applications is the spoon. in this device, two electro motors are used to control two degrees of freedom of the system and there is one gyroscope sensor to measure hand tremors. dynamics and kinematics of the system analyzed to detect the model of the system. after calculating system charesteristics, angular acceleration and position controller designed to maximize performance. at last, an experimental study and system response analysis was used to verify.
